# PIC-USB-SerialPort-and-Keyboard

* This is my attempt to implement USB serial port and keyboard with a single PIC chip.

* The source code in here will be a good example for somebody want to implement dual functionalities
with Microchip PIC processor.  Most of hard jobs are done by a set of library from Microchip,
it will be good to understand big picture.

* The dual functionalities are required to control my Android phone with simple button clicks.
For example, I can launch an application with the command comes from the serial port, and
go back to the previous screen. 

* The source code has been written with Microchip MPLABX IDE.

* PIC16F1454 is used for my design.
